# membrane-re-frame-example

A proof of concept to demonstrate using re-frame for desktop and terminal apps.

The code is largely derived from https://github.com/day8/re-frame/tree/master/examples/todomvc. Except for some browser specific code, the subs, db, and events are the same.

Both the desktop and the terminal app fully share subs, events, and db. Each has their own view.
