;; -- Spec --------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; This is a clojure.spec specification for the value in app-db. It is like a
;; Schema. See: http://clojure.org/guides/spec
;;
;; The value in app-db should always match this spec. Only event handlers
;; can change the value in app-db so, after each event handler
;; has run, we re-check app-db for correctness (compliance with the Schema).
;;
;; How is this done? Look in events.cljs and you'll notice that all handlers
;; have an "after" interceptor which does the spec re-check.
;;
;; None of this is strictly necessary. It could be omitted. But we find it
;; good practice.

;; -- Default app-db Value  ---------------------------------------------------
;;
;; When the application first starts, this will be the value put in app-db
;; Unless, of course, there are todos in the LocalStore (see further below)
;; Look in:
;;   1.  `core.cljs` for  "(dispatch-sync [:initialise-db])"
;;   2.  `events.cljs` for the registration of :initialise-db handler
;;

(def default-db           ;; what gets put into app-db by default.
  {:todos   (sorted-map)  ;; an empty list of todos. Use the (int) :id as the key
   :showing :all})        ;; show all todos


;; -- Local Storage  ----------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Part of the todomvc challenge is to store todos in LocalStorage, and
;; on app startup, reload the todos from when the program was last run.
;; But the challenge stipulates to NOT load the setting for the "showing"
;; filter. Just the todos.
;;

(def ls-key "todos-reframe")                         ;; localstore key

#_(defn todos->local-store
  "Puts todos into localStorage"
  [todos]
  (.setItem js/localStorage ls-key (str todos)))     ;; sorted-map written as an EDN map


;; -- cofx Registrations  -----------------------------------------------------

;; Use `reg-cofx` to register a "coeffect handler" which will inject the todos
;; stored in localstore.
;;
;; To see it used, look in `events.cljs` at the event handler for `:initialise-db`.
;; That event handler has the interceptor `(inject-cofx :local-store-todos)`
;; The function registered below will be used to fulfill that request.
;;
;; We must supply a `sorted-map` but in LocalStore it is stored as a `map`.
;;
;; (re-frame/reg-cofx
;;   :local-store-todos
;;   (fn [cofx _]
;;       ;; put the localstore todos into the coeffect under :local-store-todos
;;       (assoc cofx :local-store-todos
;;              ;; read in todos from localstore, and process into a sorted map
;;              (into (sorted-map)
;;                    (some->> (.getItem js/localStorage ls-key)
;;                             (cljs.reader/read-string)    ;; EDN map -> map
;;                             )))))
